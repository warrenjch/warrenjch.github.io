## Options calculators (powered by tastytrade)

[<u>Link to repo</u>]({{"https://github.com/warrenjch/tastytrade-calculator"}}){: .page-link target="_blank"}

This stuff spun out of the auxiliary functions script of the tastytrade-bot repo, which includes a bunch of things that I can't make public (strats, database). But since these auxiliary functions are quite useful on their own, such as plotting IV surfaces, term structures, implied (risk-neutral) distributions, and a whole bunch of other metrics, I placed them in this separate open repo, although you need a tastytrade account to use it.
