Opinion Expression is written by Warren Jin.

This blog started as a site for me to catalog my tryhard attempts at producing recreational mathematical work. Most of that stuff ran on an HTML website that has now been moved to the "old site" (accessible from the homepage). It was very bad both in terms of website quality and the rigor of my output. However, I am still keeping it up because it is useful to remember and cringe at the things I wrote in the past to have an idea of whether I am making any progress.

The problem was that with the layout of that site, it was difficult for me to just write unserious things that I wanted to write. Some of these things are not mathematical in nature and I would like to record them regardless. Therefore, Opinion Expression is going to be partly a collection of unserious mathematical things that I think about but would forget about in a couple of months (like a dump for scavenged goods), but also it will collect some thoughts I have on other things I care about like music, finance, what's going on in the world, etc.

I also aim to write a summary post every 3 months because that is a good amount of time to reflect on the things I have thought about and to condense them into prose. Because it happens every quarter, it will be called the quarterly opex.
